<h2><u>What I<i>Run</i></u></h2>
      
      <p><i>Currently </i> I am running 
          <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
          17.10. This being the developer model of Artful Aardvark. <br />
          Ubuntu is a great Distrobution for beginners, as it eases you into
          the Linux Environment. Ubuntu now runs GNOME which personally <br />
          very user friendly, & a great 
          <abbr title="User Experience"> UX </abbr></p>
      
      <p>This is not where my beginnings with Linux began. <br />
          Starting out I ran 
          <a href="https://getfedora.org/"> Fedora 27</a>
          . Which is another great distro, <br />
          it doesn't come as spoon-fed, & will require a bit of setting up <br />
          after installation. Fedora 27 Also runs GNOME which does ease <br />
          the configuration.</p>

<h3>What is GNOME?</h3>

      <p>GNOME makes the look & feel of the GNU/Linux Operating System <br />
          very Familiar. Self described as: 
        <cite> An easy & elegant way to use your computer</cite> <br />
          GNOME gives a similiar look to android. (As android uses linux kernel.)</p>
      <p>Running your programs in a similiar manner to that of applications. <br />
        GNOME also gives you access to the SNAP store. Making software installation <br/>
        as easy as windows. As well as giving access to tons of FOSS softwares</p>

<h3>Difference between Ubuntu & Fedora</h3>

<p>The main difference I'm going to point out is the package manager <br />
            Ubuntu uses the Debian Package managers, where Fedora uses RPM.</p>
<p>From my experience this mainly affects how certain proprietary softwares <br />
    are installed, as well as some differences or 'nuances' within Terminal. </p>
    

<h1>Basic Commands</h1>
<ol><li>Basic Directory / Creation<li>
      <ul>' pwd ' : Print working directory. Shows current directory (PATH)</ul>
        <ul>' mkdir ' : ' make directory '</ul>
            <ul>' touch ' ~> 'touch landingpage.html' : used to create a new file WITH-IN
              current directory</ul>
        <ul>' cp ' ~> 'cp landingpage.html Programming/webdev' : Can be used to copy both files & Directories  </ul>
    <li>Listing Commands</li>
                <ul> ' ls ' : list used to list all files & directories within <br />
                    with in your current directory </ul>
                    <p>List is a command you'll use quite often. It also help <br />
                    familiarize yourself with options </p>
</ol>
